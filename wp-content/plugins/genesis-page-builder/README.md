A collection of beautiful, customizable Gutenberg blocks, page layouts and sections. An extention to the already exhaustive Genesis Blocks plugin.

== Description ==

Genesis Blocks Pro is a collection of page building blocks for the WordPress block editor. Building pages with the block editor and Genesis Blocks Pro gives you more control to quickly create and launch any kind of site you want!

Installing the customizable Genesis Blocks Pro plugin adds a collection of beautiful, site-building blocks to help you customize page layouts, increase engagement, and get results for your business. Genesis Blocks Pro provides everything from customizable buttons, to beautifully-designed page sections and full-page layout designs via the Section & Layout block.

Breaking change: The Genesis Blocks Button block is deprecated in favor of the Core Buttons block.

When you open the block editor, this will automatically convert your Genesis Blocks Button blocks to the Core Buttons block.

This will not convert Button blocks if you don't open the block editor.

You might see some styling changes, especially if you have custom styling for classes other than 'gb-block-button'.

* Breaking change: Deprecate the Call To Action block in favor of Core blocks. This will automatically convert your Call To Action blocks to Core blocks when opening the block editor. The blocks should look mainly the same, but there could be some styling changes, especially if you have custom styling for classes other than 'gb-block-cta'.
* Breaking change: In the Product Features block (child of Pricing block), the settings 'List Border Color', 'List Border Style', and 'List Border Width' are removed. If you set a 'List Border Color', that color won't appear anymore. But the styling for 'List Border Width' and 'List Border Color' will be the same, you just won't be able to change those via the settings, only Advanced > Additional CSS Classes. This change will only happen when you open the block editor. So if you don't open the block editor for the post, your Product Features blocks will stay the same as before.

= 2.0.0 =
* Breaking change: Deprecate the Button block in favor of Core Buttons block. This will automatically convert your GB Button blocks to Core Buttons blocks when opening the block editor.
